#+title: Graph isomorphisms in a beamer presentation

* Introduction

This is the documentation of the LaTeX package ~graphiso.sty~. This
package is built on top of the [[http://www.ctan.org/pkg/tkz-graph][tkz-graph]] package, to show an animation
of a graph isomorphism in a beamer presentation.

The idea is simple: a graph isomorphism is shown in a beamer frame by
moving step by step all vertices in a graph from an initial position
to a final position, using beamer overlays. Any given vertex moves in
a linear path. Since the edges always join the same vertices, at each
stage we have a graph isomorphic to the first.

The package provides only two new macros: ~\VertexM~ and ~\EdgeM~ (here ~M~
stands for "movable"). 

* The macro for movable vertices

~\VertexM~ accepts one mandatory argument: the label of the movable
vertex, and some optional keys:

#+attr_html: class="center"
| key    | default value | meaning                                |
|--------+---------------+----------------------------------------|
| ~xa~     |             0 | initial ~x~ coordinate of the vertex     |
| ~ya~     |             0 | initial ~y~ coordinate of the vertex     |
| ~xb~     |             2 | final ~x~ coordinate of the vertex       |
| ~yb~     |             2 | final ~y~ coordinate of the vertex       |
| ~shows~  |             1 | overlay where the vertex first appears |
| ~starts~ |             1 | overlay where the vertex starts moving |
| ~stops~  |            10 | overlay where the vertex stops moving  |

So, for example,
~\VertexM[xa=-3,ya=3,xb=3,yb=2,shows=2,starts=3,stops=10]{x}~ indicates
a vertex labeled ~x~ that goess from (-3,3) to (3,2), shows up at the
second overlay, and movement from the third overlay to the tenth.

* The macro for movable edges

~\EdgeM~ accepts two mandatory arguments: the labels of the vertices it
joins, and some optional keys, described below. It is used to draw
edges that start being curved, gradually becoming rectilinear.

#+attr_html: class="center"
| key       | default value | meaning                              |
|-----------+---------------+--------------------------------------|
| ~bends~     |          ~left~ | direction of the bending             |
| ~bendsfrom~ |            60 | measure of the bending               |
| ~shows~     |             1 | overlay where the edge appears       |
| ~starts~    |             1 | overlay where the edge starts moving |
| ~stops~     |            10 | overlay where the edge stops moving  |

An example of the usage of this macro:
~\EdgeM[shows=6,starts=10,stops=20]{b0}{c0}~.

* Examples

There are two examples included of the usage of this package: one simple
and one complicated, closer to a "real life" example.

* Notes

- Note that the Beamer macro ~\transduration~ can be used to run the
  overlays automatically.
- This code includes code by Andrew Stacey posted at
  http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/51638/250. Such code helps in making
  sure the animation does not "jump" when going from slide to
  slide. One has to include the style ~stop jumping~ in a tikzpicture
  like so:

: \begin{tikzpicture}[stop jumping]
:   .....
: \end{tikzpicture}

  and compile twice. See the code of the examples.
